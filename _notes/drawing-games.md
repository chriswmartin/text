# Drawing Games  
  
A list of collaborative drawing games for students.   
  
## Fantastic Contraption (The Machine Game)  
As many students as possible sit in a circle around a large sheet of paper. First, the students are asked to draw some component of a machine in the space in front of them (a wheel, gears, a robotic arm, etc). After they are finished each student discusses their component with a neighbor and draws the elements that would connect their two components. Once everyone is done the whole group determines what their giant machine does, how each of their components contribute to that function, and what to name it.  
  
## Exquisite Corpse  
Each student folds a sheet of paper vertically into three equal sections and then draws the head of a creature in the top third. They then re-fold the sheet so that only the blank middle section is visible and passes the sheet to a neighbor. This next student draws a torso and folds the sheet so that only the bottom section is visible and then passes the sheet to one last student who draws the legs of a creature. Once finished, the drawing is passed back to the first student who unfolds all of the sections to reveal the complete creature. Everyone shares a name and backstory for their creature.  
  
## Subconscious Scribbles  
One person draws a quick random scribble on a sheet of paper then passes it to their neighbor. The neighbor studies the scribble, tries to think of what it could remind them of (a duck, an airplane, etc) and then completes the drawing as best they can.  
  
## Five Dots  
Each student randomly draws five dots on a piece of paper then, after trading with a neighbor, uses those dots to draw a person. One dot is where the head is, one for each leg, one for each arm. This is also fun to play as a full class on the whiteboard with each student taking a turn to come up and either draw the dots or complete the figure.  
  
## Secret Drawing  
Pair up. Each student draws something without showing their partner. Then the partner tries to recreate the drawing as well as they can. You aren’t allowed to say the name of what you drew (“a house”) — only descriptions (“a big square with a triangle on top”). How detailed and accurate your partner’s drawing is depends how descriptive you can be and how well you can communicate.
