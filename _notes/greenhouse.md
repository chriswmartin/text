## Previous ideas  
I typically like to plan out large projects in Fusion 360. This always helps me catch problems that I otherwise wouldn't realize until after beginning construction. Here is a model I made when first thinking through this project.

A lot has changed since making this model — most importantly, the side of the windows — and, unfortunately, I haven’t yet fully embraced the power of _actual_ parametric modeling so I have not yet updated this model to reflect the current design.
